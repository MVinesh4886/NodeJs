if you install in this way that is,
npm install nodemon --save  => this is for production dependencies that is used to code we want to work with. 
or 
npm install nodemon --save-dev => this is for the development environment within the project. 
or 
npm install nodemon -g => which is used globally in the machine 

after installing, we see, 
1.node_modules.
2.package-lock.json
3.updated => package.json with "deveDependencies":{"nodemon": "^3.0.1"}

after that: to run server 
we just change node to nodemon 

--> in the command prompt : nodemon start-server
