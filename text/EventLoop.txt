Thread : Processing the operating system we can say.

Javascript is a single Thread.

->Timers : Exceute setTimeout.setInterval callbacks.
->pending callbacks: Execute I/O(input &output-disk and network operations(`Blocking operations))-related callbacks that are deferred.
->Poll : Retrieve new I/O events,execute their callbacks.
->Check : Execute setImmediate() callbacks
->close callbacks: Execute all "close" event callbacks
